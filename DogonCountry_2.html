            Pip Strickland discovers kora, kola nuts and one of the African continent's most intriguing ancient cultures in Mali.
            </h3>
               	</div>
               	 <p class="">
                  Bandiagara was like countless other small, dusty West African towns I had travelled through – women stacked vegetables in neat pyramids at road-side shacks plastered with cell phone adverts, while motorbike drivers sat idly chatting, waiting for business. 
                            </p>
                  <p class="">
                            But a short distance to the east of this modern Malian reality lay one of the continent’s most intriguing ancient cultures, etched into the Bandiagara Escarpment.
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            Along this cliff face – 150km long and 500m high – the Dogon people established their villages 1,000 years ago, hidden within the sandstone to defend themselves against volatile intruders. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            This enigmatic landscape, its people and their culture, which has endured throughout the centuries, had historically attracted a steady stream of tourists on their way to and from the famous mud mosque of Djenne and the legendary town of Timbuktu in the north of the country.

                            But recent kidnappings throughout Mali have slowed this stream to a trickle and the local people are feeling the impact.
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            I arrived in Bandiagara from the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, a journey that had taken over 12 hours aboard two dusty, rickety overcrowded buses. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            On my first night in Mali, I fell asleep on a rooftop mattress while the sounds of kora, the haunting traditional calabash harp, swept around me from the courtyard below. 
                             </p>
                            
                             <p class="">
                            The following morning my guide, Ibrahim, arrived, armed with a bag of kola nuts. This caffeine-rich stimulant is a crucial part of all Malian socio-cultural activities. Armed with a healthy supply, my presence in the villages of Dogon Country would hopefully be welcomed enthusiastically. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            We loaded onto Ibrahim’s old motorbike and sped out of town along dusty, dry scrub flanked roads. A soft haze of eroded soil blanketed the landscape as the escarpment slowly came into view – a wide strip of cliffs, lodged between a strikingly flat plateau at its top. From a distance, its sandstone façade looked pockmarked with small indentations, but as we drove closer they came into view as the dwellings of the Dogon people.
                             </p>

                            Mud huts lined the road as we arrived at a village, animated with the activity of the weekly market. Women draped in vibrant African print dresses and headscarves sold fruit, vegetables, stews, and sweets, while bare-bottomed children ran between their feet and donkeys bellowed loudly. The dry surrounding landscape betrayed such an abundance of produce. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            We ascended the cliff face along a path that switchbacked through abandoned mud huts. Socio-economic pressures and environmental degradation have forced the Dogon to gradually descend from the steep escarpments to the plains below where their cultural traditions are being challenged by the threat of modernity. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            Ibrahim explained the architectural significance of each building. Togu-na are long open-air structures with an elevated platform where men traditionally sat to discuss business; gin’na are large, windowless family houses constructed over two levels and decorated with sculptured motifs. The distinctive totemic structures are known as binu.

                            I sat on a rock jutting out from the cliff face with the escarpment curving around to my right and the village sprawled out below.

                            This defensive shelter had, for some time, provided a natural refuge against formidable invaders, but what the Dogon are facing now – desertification and rebel activity – is bringing widespread poverty to the region. I asked Ibrahim what he wanted for the Dogon people. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            “I want peace. I don’t want people to only think of war, kidnappings and terror when they think of Mali.”
