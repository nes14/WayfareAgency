                        Pip Strickland explores the vibrant underwater paradise of Menjangan Island, off Bali’s north-west coast.

                </div>

                <p> As the water engulfs me and I descend below the ocean’s surface I leave the ‘real’ world behind. In this watery utopia there is no terrorism, no prejudice, no social media - it is a blissful respite. Diving is heavily addictive, like a drug that releases you of life’s pressures, it leaves you weightless and immersed in an aquatic surrealism. </p>

                <p>
                The reef that surrounds Menjangan Island in Bali’s far north-west disperses a few metres from its rocky shores then descends sharply into the deep blue. Immense Gorgonian sea fans stretch elaborately from its impressive wall, schools of luminous Blue Fin Trevally saunter past, and techni-colour parrot fish munch at its coral, spitting out unwanted chunks as they cruise idly by. It is wildly beautiful, with fish of seemingly every size and shape surrounding you amidst the rich purples of the coral. And when you look closer, you stumble upon minute pygmy seahorses clinging to the coral’s intricate web, nudibranches with wild protrusions standing fearless against predators, and feathered lion fish peeking out from hard coral nooks. It is a diver’s and snorkeller’s paradise, but the secret is out.

                Bali has long been the centre of tourism for Indonesia. The south is a party mecca for Australians, and Europeans are slowly discovering its alluring combination of natural beauty and evocative culture. It is affordable and accessible, and as tourists descend on its small shores, every corner of this paradise feels well and truly ‘discovered’. In the high season, hundreds of people clamber into the traditional blue wooden boats at Menjangan’s chaotic harbour to make the crossing to either snorkel or dive the island’s reefs. Some understand its fragility, but many don’t - standing on, touching, and ‘souveniering’ the marine species that live there.

                Menjangan is a designated marine reserve and in July this year, at the start of the high tourist season, the Indonesian Government increased the foreign tourist entrance fee from $2 to $20. In an ideal world, the inflated fee would mean more money put into the management of the park and its sustainable development. But those working in nearby Pemuteran’s dive industry and the boatmen operating the cooperative that ferries visitors the half-hour journey to the island, know this is not the case. Somebody in Jakarta is lining their pockets. 
                </p>
                <p>
                When the announcement was made, the boatmen closed the harbour in protest and the dive shops shut down for three days - they wanted the Indonesian Government to understand this decision was not good for them or for the reef - putting their prices up by a comparable amount was going to deter visitors and many would go elsewhere in Bali to dive and snorkel. But Jakarta stood strong and the national park fee was increased. In the weeks that followed, heavy seas washed rubbish onto the reef and nobody came to remove it, massive sea nets were dumped by fishermen (illegally) plying the waters surrounding the island, suffocating large clumps of coral, and the dilapidated infrastructure and toilet facilities remained unchanged.

                </div>
                <p> 
                It is a situation seen throughout many countries, when a natural landscape (whether underwater or above) becomes a lucrative source of tourism revenue and governments decide they are going to take a healthy chunk of the pie, without offering anything back for the long term sustainability of the destination. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Perhaps word will spread throughout online travel resources that Menjangan is now too expensive and numbers will dwindle, directly impacting those locals who make a small living from the dive and snorkel operations, or perhaps numbers will stay strong and the lack of management will slowly see the reef degrade and the fish species reduced. When the opportunity is there to effectively manage such a magnificent and rare resource, home to an incredible diversity of species, and create an economically sustainable tourism industry for the local population, it seems tragic that it is being overlooked in favour of short-term financial benefits for a privileged few.

            <p> <h2> Getting There</h2>
            Menjangan Island is located 10kms north-west off the shore of Bali and forms part of the West Bali National Park Conservation Area.</p>
            <p>
            Boats depart for Menjangan Island from Labuhan Lalang Harbour or Banyuwedang Bay. From Kuta, it is about a three-hour overland journey to either of these locations. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Flights to Denpasar, Bali, are frequent from various global destinations, primarily Asia and Australasia.
