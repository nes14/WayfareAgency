             Texan artist Natalie Fletcher creates arresting images by seamlessly blending models into their surrounds.

               <div class="image pull-right col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                <img src="Des_/LostLandscape/China-Hat.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>
           
           <p> Natalie Fletcher’s models are camouflaged in the landscape. Be it a mountain range, coastal setting or a grove of trees, her subjects merge seamlessly into the wilderness, blending into the natural beauty of the world around them.</p>
        

           
            <p> Fletcher, 30, spent the best part of 2015 travelling around the United States working on her ‘100 Bodies Across America’ project in which she painted two subjects from every state. Now, she’s compiling those images into both a book and an exhibition, and the video content into a short film, which she intends to enter into the Sundance Film Festival in 2016. 
            </p>
            
            <p> Fletcher’s subjects are clad only in underwear while they are painted, and meticulously blended into their surrounds.
            “I use people as art because each canvas is unique and beautiful,” Fletcher says. </p>

              <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                <img src="Des_/LostLandscape/River-Song1.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p>Fletcher, who is based in Bend, Orgeon, uses body makeup and paint to transform her subjects into mountain peaks, craggy ranges, forests or streams. A man holding his surfboard becomes part of a moody beachscape; a woman part of a mountain range; another subject becomes one with a rocky landscape, and yet another, a stunning Aspen tree. </p>

            <p>Fletcher’s talent allows her to recreate the surrounding landscape on the body, which makes the human form appear transparent as the landscape continues through the body. Fletcher compares her style of body painting to the 19th century Impressionist movement. “Up close, these paintings don’t work. But from afar, they offer an interesting illusion.”</p>

          

            <p>While Fletcher’s painted models offer a dynamic and imposing sight, the artist’s main fascination with her chosen specialty is the intimate experiences she has with each model (all of whom are volunteers).</p>



            <p>In the 45 minutes to three hours it takes to paint a person into their surroundings, Fletcher says she is an open book, and as a result, people relate to her and talk about the stories of their lives.</p>

                <img src="Des_/LostLandscape/Amanda-body-Paint-by-Natalie-Fletcher.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>

            <p>“There’s no clothes, no filters, and total open communication. It is a fascinating insight into the human spirit and turning people into art has become a segueway for me to understand more about us as people,” Fletcher says. “It is often quite an empowering experience for someone to be painted and a courageous thing to take their clothes off and have their body transformed.”</p>



            <p>The 100 Bodies Across America project includes models aged between six and 70; a project as diverse in geography as it is in    subject.</p>
            <p>“I didn’t have any restrictions or specific types of models that I wanted to use. It was more about who wanted to be part of the project,” she says.</p>


            <div class="image pull-left col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                <img src="Des_/LostLandscape/Newport-Beach.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

           

            <p>“What I enjoyed most about meeting all these people and the project as a whole is that every person I met had a story to tell. While each state has its own stereotype, everybody is very similar. Everyone has different situations and backgrounds and experiences, but we are all similar. I heard a story from someone in a cornfield in Iowa, for example, that sounds the same as one I was told by a person in the Boston Commons Park. We all have this passion and pursuit of happiness that connects us. The most common thing that links us as human beings is trying to find the balance in our relationships, whether that is with friends, partners, family or children. This project has given me a new love of humanity.”</p>


            <p>The finished project, which consists of 101 paintings, the 101st painted in Washington DC, is not only a celebration of the natural beauty of America’s diverse and distinct landscapes, it a celebration of the diversity of the human body in all its forms.
