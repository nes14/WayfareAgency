            <h3 class="section-subheading whiteFont text-center"> 
                As the snow begins to melt, the wider Wanaka region comes alive. A mecca for the outdoors, the spring and summer months offer endless options for exploring this diverse region.
            </h3>
            </div>
            
            <p class="">
                So much more than just a winter destination, the Wanaka region starts to shrug off the snow in mid-October and suddenly it’s an outdoor enthusiast’s paradise all over again. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            The best thing, however, is even throughout September and half of October, you can ski all morning, then head to the lake in the afternoon to waterski or kayak, or even for a swim. 
                            And then comes a summer of long leisurely days on the spacious beaches and endless evenings of balmy twilight. It truly is paradise on earth.</p>
                            <p class="">
                            I love to get into the mountains. There’s nothing quite like the solitude and beauty of pristine valleys and soaring peaks to revive the soul. </p>

                            </div>
                            <p class="">
                            As a dedicated nature-lover and self-confessed tree-hugger, I think this place is one of the most pure and beautiful destinations in the world. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            There’s an abundance of amazing walking tracks for everyone from the intrepid mountain climber to the ambling wanderer. Mt Aspiring is the fourth highest peak in New Zealand and the highest peak outside of Mount Cook National Park. Admired for its miraculous Matterhorn pinnacle, mountaineers use the precipitous slopes to practice for ascending Everest. </p>
                             
                            <p class="">
                            For those who aren’t mountaineers, there’s plenty of tracks offering a good half-day hike into the wild. The Rob Roy Glacier is one of my personal favourites. A breathtaking hour-long drive through the Matukituki Valley takes you to the base of the hike, then the track to the glacier is around three hours depending on your level of fitness. Other great hikes are the Isthmus Peak track in Lake Hawea and the Millennium Track, which runs from the lakefront town of Wanaka to Glendhu Bay, about 10 kilometres along the lake shore.</p>

                            If beating the trails on foot is not your thing, I recently discovered the exhilaration of mountain biking. I’m no expert, but I managed a two-day trip into the mountains – and survived! Not only did I survive, I loved it. It’ll take me a while to get comfortable with jumps but there are so many great tracks for biking around Wanaka. Guides are available for those wanting a bit more of a challenge, and heli biking is becoming hugely popular in the area. There are also two new bike parks at the winter ski areas of Cardrona and Snow Farm. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Of course, when exploring on foot or on bike, remember late spring and early summer will bring the snow melt when rivers run a little higher so check conditions with the local Department of Conservation office before setting off.

                            If you’re more into softer adventure, or just love a good wine, try a vineyard tour after your morning activity. There are local wine tours available, or, if you’re up for a drive, take yourself on a trip around the region with a wine map. Rippon Vineyard is one of the oldest vineyards in the region, and indeed in the entire wine growing region of Central Otago. It has been in the same family for over 100 years and boasts some of the best views in town.</p>

                            <p class="">
                            One of the largest attractions in the Wanaka region is, of course, the lakes. Lake Wanaka and Lake Hawea are both blessed with outstandingly beautiful surroundings and pure clean water. In spring there can be a bit of wind around and the lakes are brilliant for wind surfing and kite surfing. They are also exceptional fishing lakes flush with salmon and rainbow and brown trout. If you don’t know much about fishing but want to have a go, there are many local fishing guides who will take you out to spin a reel and have a yarn. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Kayaking and paddleboarding are popular in the spring and summer seasons too and the lakefront beach has both to hire throughout the spring and summer months. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            But I have to say, my favourite thing to do in Wanaka is to fly. The dramatic landscapes are outstanding and to see them from the air is simply amazing.
