                                <h2 class="text-center">Ghetto Tarot</h2>
                                <h3 class="section-subheading whiteFont text-center">
                                Belgian photographer Alice Smeets fell in love with Haiti at the age of 19. Her career has centred on its plight, and potential, ever since.
                               </h3>
                           </div>

                           
                           <p class="">

                           Growing up in Eupen, a small town in the German speaking region of Belgium near Cologne, Smeets, 28, had a typically Western upbringing. When she finished high school she left for New Zealand to learn English. 
                            </p>
                           <p class="">
                            It was amidst the evocative landscapes of Aotearoa where Smeets found her passion for photography and first purchased a semi-professional camera. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            After six months though, she returned to Belgium to study photography at a tertiary level, realising that New Zealand was too similar to her homeland to truly enrich her understanding of the world. She craved different, richer cultural experiences.
                            During a university semester break, Smeets set foot on Haitian soil for the first time and ignited her love affair with the country and its people. She spent a number of weeks exploring and photographing children growing up in Haiti’s vast poverty-stricken areas.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Smeets realised she wanted to tell stories with her photographs; to incite change and to open the eyes of the Western world to the circumstances and lives of those in countries such as Haiti.
                            “When I got back to Belgium, I decided the university course wasn’t for me and I was lucky enough to be able to assist famous war photographer Philip Jones Griffiths for three months. They were the last three months of his life. It was a very, very intense time,” she says.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Griffiths not only taught her about lighting, composition and photojournalism, but to ask questions. “I learnt not to just go places and look through the filters of your own upbringing; but to question everything; question the situation, question what you see.”
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Pursuing her dream to incite change, Smeets continued to visit Haiti frequently over the following four years, and finally moved there in 2011.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Her photography continued to develop, alongside her other interests – she set up and ran a workshop to teach Haitians how to become professional photographers.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “But I became disillusioned with the NGO system after my experiences in Haiti over the last few years. I saw how hard it is to really help. There were so many things going wrong with the NGO system but nobody wanted to talk about it because the people involved were all there with the right intentions.”
                            As a consequence, Smeets decided to direct a documentary about the negative effects NGOs were having, using Haiti as an example 
                            of similar countries’ plights. 
                              </p>
                              <div class="image pull-left col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                                <img src="Des_/unnamed-2.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                <p class="lead">
                                    Instead of looking at Haiti as a poor country and showing this to the world with my photographs I wanted to show poverty in a different light – to describe with my images how I see Haiti now.
                                </p>
                              </div>
                           <p class="">
                            “If we help in the wrong way, it can destroy a country,” Smeets says. “One of the many things that are going wrong in Haiti is the victimisation of the people. Many NGO workers don’t even realise they are doing this. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “For the last 50 years, Haitians have witnessed white people come into their country and do everything for them. When an NGO goes to Haiti, it doesn’t let Haitians decide how to lead change so the people are there left to witness, rather than lead, the change. If the change is done for them, they become victims of the situation. 
                            “If there is a problem in Haiti now, people don’t think: ‘What can I do to solve the problem?’ instead, they look to the NGOs to fix it. It’s a very strong mentality in Haiti. They have lost their self confidence about solving problems.”
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Smeet’s disillusion with the NGO system led her to stop taking photographs for a year. She felt helpless about the situation and couldn’t see how to do anything of any worth for Haitians.
                            But then she came up with the idea of creating the Ghetto Tarot, and her inspiration returned.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “For a long time, I had wanted to interpret the Tarot Deck with my photos, but taking ordinary pictures of the scenes seemed too simple.,” Smeets says. “My aim was to create a very personal deck without loosing the different spirits of the cards. Then the idea
                            entered my mind to combine three of my passions: the spiritual world, the Haitian culture and people, as well as philosophical reflections about the dualities in our world; in this case rich and poor.”

                            The resulting Ghetto Tarot is an avant-garde collection of work like no other. A photographic representation of the Rider Waite Tarot deck, originally designed in 1909 by artist Pamela Colman Smith, many of the cards use Haitian art, which includes symbolism from the Voodoo religion to embody the meaning of the cards’ original symbols. “While the original cards were designed many years ago with the situations of a time when the world was very different, they still resonate today with timeless symbols that can be applied to our busy modern world. And not just our modern, Western world, but also to any other continent, country or culture, including the Haitian Ghetto,” Smeets said.

                           <p class="">
                            “I realised that instead of looking at Haiti as a poor country and showing this to the world with my photographs, I wanted to show poverty in a different light – to describe with my images how I see Haiti now, as a country rich in creativity and talent and with so much potential.”
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Created by Smeets in collaboration with Haitian artists’ collective Atis Rezistans (Resistance Artists), each image of the Ghetto Tarot was shot in the slums, and styled only with items that were sourced, or created, in the area. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “The artists I collaborated with are so rich in creativity and strength. They don’t see the misery of the area they are living in, but instead see the potential of using the trash that surrounds them and turning it into art. They provide us with a very valuable lesson; we can choose if we see the trash as a problem or as inspiration. Whatever problem we have, whatever negativity we feel, if we choose to look at it from a different perspective we can instantly change the situation. This is the essence of the Ghetto Tarot. It is about how we can all change our reality if we alter our perception.” <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ghetto-tarot-take-two#/" target="_blank">ghettotarot.com</a>

                            Bandiagara was like countless other small, dusty West African towns I had travelled through – women stacked vegetables in neat pyramids at road-side shacks plastered with cell phone adverts, while motorbike drivers sat idly chatting, waiting for business.

                            But a short distance to the east of this modern Malian reality lay one of the continent’s most intriguing ancient cultures, etched into the Bandiagara Escarpment.

                             <p class="">
                            Along this cliff face – 150km long and 500m high – the Dogon people established their villages 1,000 years ago, hidden within the sandstone to defend themselves against volatile intruders.

                            This enigmatic landscape, its people and their culture, which has endured throughout the centuries, had historically attracted a steady stream of tourists on their way to and from the famous mud mosque of Djenne and the legendary town of Timbuktu in the north of the country.

                             <p class="">
                            I arrived in Bandiagara from the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, a journey that had taken over 12 hours aboard two dusty, rickety overcrowded buses. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            On my first night in Mali, I fell asleep on a rooftop mattress while the sounds of kora, the haunting traditional calabash harp, swept around me from the courtyard below. 
                             </p>

                            The following morning my guide, Ibrahim, arrived, armed with a bag of kola nuts. This caffeine-rich stimulant is a crucial part of all Malian socio-cultural activities. Armed with a healthy supply, my presence in the villages of Dogon Country would hopefully be welcomed enthusiastically. 
                             </p>
                             <p class="">
                            We loaded onto Ibrahim’s old motorbike and sped out of town along dusty, dry scrub flanked roads. A soft haze of eroded soil blanketed the landscape as the escarpment slowly came into view – a wide strip of cliffs, lodged between a strikingly flat plateau at its top. From a distance, its sandstone façade looked pockmarked with small indentations, but as we drove closer they came into view as the dwellings of the Dogon people.

                            Mud huts lined the road as we arrived at a village, animated with the activity of the weekly market. Women draped in vibrant African print dresses and headscarves sold fruit, vegetables, stews, and sweets, while bare-bottomed children ran between their feet and donkeys bellowed loudly. The dry surrounding landscape betrayed such an abundance of produce.

                            We ascended the cliff face along a path that switchbacked through abandoned mud huts. Socio-economic pressures and environmental degradation have forced the Dogon to gradually descend from the steep escarpments to the plains below where their cultural traditions are being challenged by the threat of modernity.

                            Ibrahim explained the architectural significance of each building. Togu-na are long open-air structures with an elevated platform where men traditionally sat to discuss business; gin’na are large, windowless family houses constructed over two levels and decorated with sculptured motifs. The distinctive totemic structures are known as binu.

                            The mist rolled in from the sea, disguising massive icebergs in a soft white veil. Locals retreated into their humble homes as the mist grew heavy and temperatures dropped. Ilulissat, a large town on Greenland’s west coast was transformed from a colourful seaside village into an airy and deserted place.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Only the sled dogs remained in the now white landscape. Distant howls echoed across the small town as white dogs curled up and took shelter in their wooden kennels. But one pack remained atop a mist covered hilltop beside Hotel Arctic. Their tail wagging, wide-eyed excitement was aimed at a man in blue overalls clanking a cart down a wooden boardwalk towards them. It was feeding time in the Arctic.

                                        These dogs form part of Greenlandic history and culture. Dog-sledding, ice-fishing and life among freezing temperatures are synonymous with the Arctic and Greenland’s indigenous Inuit people.

                            Fighting their chains, the dogs splashed through the mud towards a bucket of food scraps closely guarded by the hotel’s manager, Erik Bjerregaard. Fifteen messy minutes later the dogs were quiet and still, except for their happily wagging tails. Like a proud parent, Bjerregaard rubbed the puppies’ grubby tummies and scratched the older dogs’ ears with his magic fingers. You can learn a lot about a man by the way he treats his dogs. And if these furry customers were anything to go by, we were in for a treat staying at the world’s northernmost four-star hotel.
                            The Dane’s 15 dogs are a great cause of joy for him, whether hunting in the winter months or taking pride of place in front of the hotel. The view of Ilulissat’s harbour and working fisherman, including Bjerregaard’s dogs, is hard to ignore from any of the hotel’s 85 rooms, five contemporary igloos or five-star rated conference facilities. But, more than a centerpiece, these dogs form part of Greenlandic history and culture. Dog-sledding, ice-fishing and life among freezing temperatures are synonymous with the Arctic and Greenland’s indigenous Inuit people.

                            Mounting pressure and media scrutiny have reached the Arctic nations in recent years, in particular Greenland, where the Inuit’s landscape and culture are under attack from climate change. Effects of global warming are taking their toll on daily life in Greenland, and in particular the role of its famous sled dogs. These huskies provide the most important and ancient form of transportation in the polar regions.
                            </p>

                            Although physically similar to the Canadian sled dog, the Greenlandic breed is slightly taller and not as heavy. They are renowned for their high endurance, strength and ability to thrive in some of the harshest conditions on the planet, aided by their dense undercoat and thick outer coat which sheds in summer. This vital coat allows them to withstand freezing temperatures below -40 and -60 degrees Celsius. Huskies have extremely powerful jaws and small triangular ears which avoid frostbite. Their iconic bushy tails curl over the dogs’ back and protect their faces from the cold while sleeping. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Sadly, due to the onslaught of climate change in the region, the sled dogs are becoming obsolete. Greenland’s dog numbers have reduced to a third in the last two decades. Ilulissat’s dog population has reduced from 6000 to 1800 in just 20 years.

                            The decline in the use of sled dogs is a sign that climate change is already taking its toll. In previous years, autumn temperatures would begin to drop and the sea would freeze for the duration of winter. In the winter months these dogs would pull heavy laden sleds across the ice to hunt seals and polar bears. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Today, due to the effects of global warming, the sea ice is unpredictable. In places such as Ilulissat, the constant fluctuations between frozen and unfrozen ocean make it impossible to use either dog sleds or boats. During this time the locals cannot go hunting or fishing at all. It is referred to as the dead period.

                            When the ice finally freezes it may only remain for two or three weeks. Consequently, the lack of ice and high cost of keeping dogs in Ilulissat has led many hunters and fishermen to replace their sleds with boats. With no sea ice, the need for sled dogs diminishes and some animals remain chained up and malnourished for months at a time. Luckily for Bjerregaard’s dogs, they may be the best nurtured, and certainly the best fed dogs in Greenland, being fed scraps by chef Jeppe Ejvind Nielsen from the hotel’s restaurant Ulo.

                            Bjerregaard is doing his bit to help Greenlandic dogs and the environment. During his 22 years as manager, the 70-plus-year-old Dane has watched the hotel transform into a CO2 neutral, environmentally sustainable, four-star hotel with water saving toilets, taps, shower heads and 240m2 of solar panels which generate 20 per cent of the hotel’s daily electricity use (except in December and January when there is no sun).

                            <p class="">
                            In his 70s, Bjerregaard views his age as an advantage, not a weakness. “When you get older you learn everything you learnt during your teenage years as a young man makes sense,” he says. He also supports Greenlandic artists like Miki Jagasen, whose work fills the hotel’s walls. Artists include Bjerregaard’s wife Susannah who runs the Glacier Shop in Ilulissat’s town centre. But his weak spot is for the works of Danish photographer Carsten Egevang, whose photographic prints of husky dogs fill the dining hall’s entrance. These works, unlike the dogs’ Greenlandic population, are continually growing in numbers.

                                    As the snow begins to melt, the wider Wanaka region comes alive. A mecca for the outdoors, the spring and summer months offer endless options for exploring this diverse region.
                                   </h3>

                            <p class="">
                                So much more than just a winter destination, the Wanaka region starts to shrug off the snow in mid-October and suddenly it’s an outdoor enthusiast’s paradise all over again. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            The best thing, however, is even throughout September and half of October, you can ski all morning, then head to the lake in the afternoon to waterski or kayak, or even for a swim. 
                            And then comes a summer of long leisurely days on the spacious beaches and endless evenings of balmy twilight. It truly is paradise on earth.</p>

                            I love to get into the mountains. There’s nothing quite like the solitude and beauty of pristine valleys and soaring peaks to revive the soul. </p>

                            As a dedicated nature-lover and self-confessed tree-hugger, I think this place is one of the most pure and beautiful destinations in the world. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            There’s an abundance of amazing walking tracks for everyone from the intrepid mountain climber to the ambling wanderer. Mt Aspiring is the fourth highest peak in New Zealand and the highest peak outside of Mount Cook National Park. Admired for its miraculous Matterhorn pinnacle, mountaineers use the precipitous slopes to practice for ascending Everest. </p>
                             
                            <p class="">
                            For those who aren’t mountaineers, there’s plenty of tracks offering a good half-day hike into the wild. The Rob Roy Glacier is one of my personal favourites. A breathtaking hour-long drive through the Matukituki Valley takes you to the base of the hike, then the track to the glacier is around three hours depending on your level of fitness. Other great hikes are the Isthmus Peak track in Lake Hawea and the Millennium Track, which runs from the lakefront town of Wanaka to Glendhu Bay, about 10 kilometres along the lake shore.</p>

                            If beating the trails on foot is not your thing, I recently discovered the exhilaration of mountain biking. I’m no expert, but I managed a two-day trip into the mountains – and survived! Not only did I survive, I loved it. It’ll take me a while to get comfortable with jumps but there are so many great tracks for biking around Wanaka. Guides are available for those wanting a bit more of a challenge, and heli biking is becoming hugely popular in the area. There are also two new bike parks at the winter ski areas of Cardrona and Snow Farm. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Of course, when exploring on foot or on bike, remember late spring and early summer will bring the snow melt when rivers run a little higher so check conditions with the local Department of Conservation office before setting off.

                            If you’re more into softer adventure, or just love a good wine, try a vineyard tour after your morning activity. There are local wine tours available, or, if you’re up for a drive, take yourself on a trip around the region with a wine map. Rippon Vineyard is one of the oldest vineyards in the region, and indeed in the entire wine growing region of Central Otago. It has been in the same family for over 100 years and boasts some of the best views in town.</p>

                            One of the largest attractions in the Wanaka region is, of course, the lakes. Lake Wanaka and Lake Hawea are both blessed with outstandingly beautiful surroundings and pure clean water. In spring there can be a bit of wind around and the lakes are brilliant for wind surfing and kite surfing. They are also exceptional fishing lakes flush with salmon and rainbow and brown trout. If you don’t know much about fishing but want to have a go, there are many local fishing guides who will take you out to spin a reel and have a yarn. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Kayaking and paddleboarding are popular in the spring and summer seasons too and the lakefront beach has both to hire throughout the spring and summer months. </p>
                            <p class="">
                            But I have to say, my favourite thing to do in Wanaka is to fly. The dramatic landscapes are outstanding and to see them from the air is simply amazing.

                                In the isolated Arctic town of Churchill, the bears wait around the shore for the sea ice to form every autumn having left their dens on the tundra surrounding the town, where the subsoil remains permanently frozen. </p>

                                The Churchill bears are one of 19 polar bear populations in the world, and by far the most accessible due to their habitual autumnul wait on the edges of the coastal town. Churchill is one of the few human settlements where polar bears can be observed in the wild. According to Manitoba Conservation, polar bears in this area are in decline due to a three per cent loss to the extent of the ice pack every decade, and a spring ice break up occuring approximately three weeks earlier than historical records indicate. When the ice melts, the bears come ashore and fast for about four months, living on stored fat until the following winter. While the majority of bears fast for about four months, pregnant females remain on land to give birth and fast for about eight months. The changing seasonal conditions are also affecting the ringed seal, according to Manitoba Conservation, due to spring rains impacting their maternity dens.</p>

                                In fall, as the ice forms, ringed seals cut breathing holes in the ice using the sharp claws on their foreflippers. These holes are kept open all winter in ice that can get up to two metres thick.
                                The seals surface every few minutes at one of these holes, or use air pockets trapped under ice to breathe. Polar bears stalk their prey by waiting at a breathing hole, sometimes for hours or days. 
                                Weighing in at around 500kg, an adult polar bear can drag a seal from the water with its claws. But ringed seals also bask on the ice and make easy prey for the bears who use the seals’ sleep-wake pattern to slowly creep up on their prey before darting at the seal at explosive speed and killing it before it can retreat to the safety of the ocean.</p>

                                <p class="">
                               As we round the corner on our bikes, we see Natua sitting outside on a stool, sanding the back of a partially completed ukulele. He greets us and as we lay our bikes on the grass, he beckons us inside his work shed.
                                Natua is a young Cook Islander with a very special talent. He makes custom-made ukuleles for discerning musicians.</p>
                                <p class="">
                                We have called in to see him as part of a ‘Storytellers’ eco cycle tour around Rarotonga. Our storyteller, Rebecca, is one of several locals, guiding tourists around the island to learn about the local culture, history and environment.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                It’s not hard to see Natua has a wicked sense of humor. When I ask him how long he has been doing this for, he says, “Since nine o’clock this morning.” Laughing, he corrects himself and says, “I’ve has been making ukuleles for about four years.”
                                </p>
                                <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                                    <img src="Des_/shutterstock_159678242Z.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                  
                                 </div>
                                <p class="">
                                With not a tool out of place or a wood shaving on the floor, he explains how he has had no formal training. “My first ukulele was full of mistakes so I gave it away,” he says. “The second wasn’t much better so I gave it away too,” he says chuckling. He likens his craft to fixing a car, trial and error, but I think there is more to it than that.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                Natua is passionate about his work and is clearly a very talented musician. He believes it is important to put your soul into your ukulele, so encourages his clients to be involved in the crafting process. Some clients like to work with him for a couple of days, while others come just for the finishing touches.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                We say goodbye to Natua and cycle to an agriculture patch owned by one of Rebecca’s relatives. Once an orange orchard, there are a few remaining orange trees and we taste the ripe, sweet fruit, but it is predominantly a pineapple and banana plantation now. The banana trees are lush and very much part of the tropical vegetation but what catches my eye is a beautiful banana flower. The large, purple, bulbous looking flower, hangs from the end of a large bunch of bananas. Peeling back a layer, very small flowers are visible. Each one will soon mature into a banana.
                                </p>
                                <div class="image pull-right col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                                    <img src="Des_/Bananaflower_CookIslandsZ.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                   
                                 </div>
                                <p class="">
                                Rebecca explains much of the local vegetation is still used for medicinal purposes including the fragrant frangipani. Demonstrating, she snaps a small branch off the tree, allowing the sap to run freely. This is the remedy for a bee string she says.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                Our next stop is a swamp taro plantation. Having learnt what is involved in the growing and harvesting of this crop, I have a greater appreciation for this local delicacy. The taro seedling is planted in water, under a mat of palm fronds. It is difficult and time consuming to grow but the plant has deep cultural and practical significance. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                One aspect of Rarotonga, that saddens me is the unfinished and now derelict, Sheraton Hotel. 
                                I asked Rebecca if we could visit the site, as it is now a tourist attraction in a weird kind of way. 
                                Thirty years ago, in the mid 1980’s “experts” from the United Nations Development Programme advised the Cook Island government to allow more large hotels. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                With that in mind, the government borrowed $50 million from an Italian Bank and an Italian contracting company started the build. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                However, the construction company went broke and another was bought in from Italy to complete the job, but again the work halted, following mafia allegations.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                The locals believe the site is cursed but whatever the reason for its checked history, there are no plans to bring it back to life or demolish it.</p>
