                                    Thomas Seear-Budd and Talia Carlisle discover the icy town of Ilulissat on Greenland's West Coast
                                   </h3>

                            The mist rolled in from the sea, disguising massive icebergs in a soft white veil. Locals retreated into their humble homes as the mist grew heavy and temperatures dropped. Ilulissat, a large town on Greenland’s west coast was transformed from a colourful seaside village into an airy and deserted place.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Only the sled dogs remained in the now white landscape. Distant howls echoed across the small town as white dogs curled up and took shelter in their wooden kennels. But one pack remained atop a mist covered hilltop beside Hotel Arctic. Their tail wagging, wide-eyed excitement was aimed at a man in blue overalls clanking a cart down a wooden boardwalk towards them. It was feeding time in the Arctic.

                                        These dogs form part of Greenlandic history and culture. Dog-sledding, ice-fishing and life among freezing temperatures are synonymous with the Arctic and Greenland’s indigenous Inuit people.

                            Fighting their chains, the dogs splashed through the mud towards a bucket of food scraps closely guarded by the hotel’s manager, Erik Bjerregaard. Fifteen messy minutes later the dogs were quiet and still, except for their happily wagging tails. Like a proud parent, Bjerregaard rubbed the puppies’ grubby tummies and scratched the older dogs’ ears with his magic fingers. You can learn a lot about a man by the way he treats his dogs. And if these furry customers were anything to go by, we were in for a treat staying at the world’s northernmost four-star hotel.
                            The Dane’s 15 dogs are a great cause of joy for him, whether hunting in the winter months or taking pride of place in front of the hotel. The view of Ilulissat’s harbour and working fisherman, including Bjerregaard’s dogs, is hard to ignore from any of the hotel’s 85 rooms, five contemporary igloos or five-star rated conference facilities. But, more than a centerpiece, these dogs form part of Greenlandic history and culture. Dog-sledding, ice-fishing and life among freezing temperatures are synonymous with the Arctic and Greenland’s indigenous Inuit people.

                            <p class="">
                            Mounting pressure and media scrutiny have reached the Arctic nations in recent years, in particular Greenland, where the Inuit’s landscape and culture are under attack from climate change. Effects of global warming are taking their toll on daily life in Greenland, and in particular the role of its famous sled dogs. These huskies provide the most important and ancient form of transportation in the polar regions.
                            </p>
                              <div class="image pull-left col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                                    <img src="Des_/HI4A6886.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>

                            <p class="">
                            Although physically similar to the Canadian sled dog, the Greenlandic breed is slightly taller and not as heavy. They are renowned for their high endurance, strength and ability to thrive in some of the harshest conditions on the planet, aided by their dense undercoat and thick outer coat which sheds in summer. This vital coat allows them to withstand freezing temperatures below -40 and -60 degrees Celsius. Huskies have extremely powerful jaws and small triangular ears which avoid frostbite. Their iconic bushy tails curl over the dogs’ back and protect their faces from the cold while sleeping. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Sadly, due to the onslaught of climate change in the region, the sled dogs are becoming obsolete. Greenland’s dog numbers have reduced to a third in the last two decades. Ilulissat’s dog population has reduced from 6000 to 1800 in just 20 years.
                            </p>
                               <div class="image pull-right col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                                    <img src="Des_/HI4A6939.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                   
                            </div>
                            <p class="">
                            The decline in the use of sled dogs is a sign that climate change is already taking its toll. In previous years, autumn temperatures would begin to drop and the sea would freeze for the duration of winter. In the winter months these dogs would pull heavy laden sleds across the ice to hunt seals and polar bears. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            Today, due to the effects of global warming, the sea ice is unpredictable. In places such as Ilulissat, the constant fluctuations between frozen and unfrozen ocean make it impossible to use either dog sleds or boats. During this time the locals cannot go hunting or fishing at all. It is referred to as the dead period. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            When the ice finally freezes it may only remain for two or three weeks. Consequently, the lack of ice and high cost of keeping dogs in Ilulissat has led many hunters and fishermen to replace their sleds with boats. With no sea ice, the need for sled dogs diminishes and some animals remain chained up and malnourished for months at a time. Luckily for Bjerregaard’s dogs, they may be the best nurtured, and certainly the best fed dogs in Greenland, being fed scraps by chef Jeppe Ejvind Nielsen from the hotel’s restaurant Ulo.

                            <p class="">
                            Bjerregaard is doing his bit to help Greenlandic dogs and the environment. During his 22 years as manager, the 70-plus-year-old Dane has watched the hotel transform into a CO2 neutral, environmentally sustainable, four-star hotel with water saving toilets, taps, shower heads and 240m2 of solar panels which generate 20 per cent of the hotel’s daily electricity use (except in December and January when there is no sun).
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                            In his 70s, Bjerregaard views his age as an advantage, not a weakness. “When you get older you learn everything you learnt during your teenage years as a young man makes sense,” he says. He also supports Greenlandic artists like Miki Jagasen, whose work fills the hotel’s walls. Artists include Bjerregaard’s wife Susannah who runs the Glacier Shop in Ilulissat’s town centre. But his weak spot is for the works of Danish photographer Carsten Egevang, whose photographic prints of husky dogs fill the dining hall’s entrance. These works, unlike the dogs’ Greenlandic population, are continually growing in numbers.
