            <h2> Grindelwald, Switzerland </h2> 

            <p> 
            A celestial pillow fight of monumental proportions was declared the night we arrived in the Swiss alpine village of Grindelwald. I love a serious blizzard so I stood out on the balcony of our chalet until the snow stuck to my eyelashes and began to freeze. When I peeked out the window at 4am, it was still snowing heavily . . . but no one else in our Kiwi quintet seemed remotely interested at my announcement that 50cm of the prayed-for white stuff had fallen overnight. 
            </p>

            </div>

            <p> The shadow of the mighty Eiger loomed above us and wisps of pink cloud hung in the evening sky, keeping company with a pale sickle moon. </p>

            <p> In the days that followed, we travelled by Jungfrau Railways to ski at Kleiner Scheidegg, part of a vast domain linked to Lauberhorn, Männlichen and Wengen by a network of chairlifts, gondolas, trains and massive cablecars. </p>

            <p>We skied high above the valley and lunched at a quaint restaurant at Kleiner Scheidegg, a tiny alpine village in the shadow of the Eiger (3970m), Mönch (4107m) and Jungfau (4158m). A cluster of hotels, chalets and restaurants nestle at the foot of Eigergletscher (Eiger Glacier), the railway station where passengers embark on the trip of a lifetime to Jungfraujoch (3454m), the highest-altitude railway station in Europe. </p>

            </div>

            <p>I spent an afternoon at the “Top of Europe” where the view from the Sphinx Terrace (3571m) is literally breath-taking - a spectacular 360-degree panorama with row-upon-row of mountain peaks and glaciers stretching across Switzerland, France, Italy and Germany. </p>

            <p>Skiing was thrilling enough for me but the younger members of our team tried out the First Flyer, an 800m-long flying fox from First to Schreckfeld which reaches speeds of 84km/h. There are four harnesses on cables side-by-side so you don’t have to go it alone. I’m reliably informed the experience is an eye-popping adrenalin buzz . . . and it’s included in the lift pass so you can fly as many times as you want.</p>

            <p> Just before we left we embarked on a sleigh ride, buried under layers of fur and sheep-skin (or possibly lama-skin) blankets, sipping champagne that nearly froze in our glasses. Our driver Heinrich Egger, who owns the sleigh business, seemed unfazed by the sub-zero temperatures as his two sturdy horses trotted along the river and around the little village which was even more picturesque at night with Christmas decorations suspended above. It was a magical experience. -Justine Tyerman</p>

            <h2> Le Grand Bornand, France</h2> 

            <p> A farming village for centuries, the alpine community of Le Grand Bornand has long links with the mountains and the fertile lands which lie at high altitudes in the Haute-Savoie region of south-eastern France. </p>



            <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                <img src="Des_/AplineWinter/048-A-CHIENS-TRAINEAUX-LEBEAU-H13 copy.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p>We visited Le Grand Bornand in spring. At this time of year (March) snow still covers the village; on most buildings the snow was up to 50cms thick, and the ski areas and beyond were covered with a powder that rivals any seen in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

            <p>In the heart of the Aravis Mountains, Le Grand Bornand lies between Mont Blanc, Lake Annecy and the Swiss border. </p>

            <p>The village itself is separated across two distinct elevations; Le Grand Bornand at 1,000 metres, and Le Grand Bornand Chinaillon six kilometres up the road at 1300 metres. Chinaillon is the main base for skiing and snowboarding, although the extensive slopes are accessible from either part of the village.</p>

            <p>Steeped in history, the well-preserved historic village centre dates back to the 17th Century and its architecture still informs that of the contemporary dwellings and civic structures.</p>

            <p>The town sits at the base of an extensive ski area, of which 29 lifts and two gondolas allow access to 90km of exquisitely groomed runs while 184 snow cannons cover 86 hectares of terrain.</p>

            </div>

            

            <p>Off piste terrain options are abundant and worth a look if you can. Guided tours operate frequently taking skiers to parts of the mountains that aren’t otherwise easily accessible. </p>

            <p>But skiing and snowboarding aren’t the only winter activities locals here rave about. The ski bike was invented in a neighbouring village and the locals love pedalling their invention. </p>

            <p>We set out on a ski bike trip not knowing quite what to expect. Clad in our ski gear and hiking shoes we met our guide and were swiftly bundled onto a chairlift with the bikes hooked on behind us.</p>

            <p>At the top of a green run, we were given little instruction other than how to brake and off we went. Minutes into it and I realised why there was such a lack of direction: it’s easy. If you can ride a bike, you can ride a ski bike. </p>

            <p>It’s a heady sensation riding down the ski field on a bike of sorts, and one that we took immense pleasure in as we quickly became more confident. </p>

            </div>

            <p>Le Grand Bornand is also a great destination for snowshoeing due to its expansive historical and working farm buildings dotted across the mountains. </p>

            <p>We took to the hills behind Chinaillon and found ourselves in a vast expanse within minutes surrounded by towering near-vertical cliff faces and waist-deep snow. Along the way we were lucky enough to spot a bearded vulture and a group of ibeks high above us on a steep cliff face.</p>
            <p>This is a town that knows its strengths and provides an alluring, unique mountain escape; an experience that sets Le Grand Bornand apart from its more well-known resort neighbour, Chamonix. - Clare Chapman. </p>
