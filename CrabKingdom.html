              Australia’s tiny territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos Keeling Islands aren’t exactly easily accessible, located nearly 3,000 kilometres from Perth, but they offer a truly remote experience in the Indian Ocean.

            <p>Standing still as the ground beneath your feet turns into a spectacular moving crimson mass of tens of thousands of land crabs, or diving into the ocean to surface in an underwater cave decorated with stalagmites and stalactites and lit by bioluminescent fish is just the beginning of the natural wonders that this island has to offer.</p>


            <p>A tiny speck of land 2,600 kilometres north-west of Perth, Christmas Island rises majestically from the tropical depths of the Indian Ocean. Here, on this isolated island the wonder of nature is all encompassing. From the lush rainforests to the thrilling diving options, and the solitude of its isolation, Christmas Island is an intriguing destination.</p>

           

            <p>Despite its isolated geographical location, which by distance is closest to Java, Indonesia, the island is an Australian territory, along with its neighbour, the Cocos Keeling Islands.</p>
           
            <p>Both the Cocos Keeling and Christmas islands are surrounded by the clear waters of the fringe of Asia and offer utter seclusion, each with their own distinct highlights. </p>

            

            <p>Christmas Island itself was formed from the peak of an undersea volcano that rose from the floor of the ocean about 60 million years ago. It is surrounded by a narrow coral reef that drops away steeply into the Java Trench, the deepest part of the Indian Ocean. More than 200 species of coral thrive in the tropical waters while around 600 species of fish have been identified in the region. </p>
             <div class="col-lg-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-lg-12 modal_ smallCrabModal">
              
            </div>

            <p>Measuring just 135km2, Christmas Island is home to more than 180 different species of water, land and shore crabs and approximately 50 million of the iconic red land crabs. Somewhat appropriately, Christmas time coincides with the red land crabs’ spectacular mass migration from the forest to the coast where they breed and the females release eggs into the sea. </p>
             


            <p>Red crabs are large – an adult body shell measures around 116mm in diameter. For most of the year the crabs settle in one place, living in solitude in burrows in the forest and surviving on a diet of fallen leaves, fruit, seedlings and flowers.</p>

                <p class="lead center-text">
                 Walking carefully amongst a moving sea of red crabs is a truly dramatic experience ... their journey is an unstoppable wave of colour and a sight to behold                       
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <p>But from November onwards, they migrate en masse, turning the island into a moving crimson carpet. Males lead the first wave of the migration and are joined by the females soon after. They mate in purpose-built burrows dug around the shore. The females produce eggs within three days of mating and remain in the moist burrows near the shore for about two weeks while the eggs develop. The eggs are held in a brood pouch between their extended abdomen and thorax with a single female producing up to 100,000 eggs.</p>

            <p>Walking carefully amongst a moving sea of red crabs is a truly dramatic experience. Their journey is an unstoppable wave of colour and a sight to behold, as is watching the egg-laden females dance at dawn as they release their eggs into the ocean.</p>



            <p>But if you’re more interested in what’s under the sea, Christmas Island offers an oasis of calm in its unparalleled underwater paradise. With average water temperatures of 27 degrees year-round, it is here you will find what is arguably some of the world’s best diving. You will encounter the thrill of watching majestic creatures glide by, including the gentle whale shark (between November and April) and mantra ray, explore the vibrant coral reef and see the kaleidoscopic array of coloured fish that live amongst it.</p>

            
            <p>While there are dive options to suit all levels of experience, this is the place to come if you’re after a thrill. The vertical wall dives where the Java Trench drops off are exhilarating, while simply snorkeling off the beach will give you a clear idea of dives where the Java Trench drops off are exhilarating, while simply snorkeling off the beach will give you a clear idea of what’s beyond.</p>

            <p>The ocean’s relentless erosion of the island’s limestone cliffs has created a honeycomb of caves at sea level which you can access by diving, and then surfacing in huge air-filled domes covered in stalagmites and stalactites which are lit by tiny bioluminescent fish.</p>

            <p>While Christmas Island is known for it’s relaxed pace and dramatic array of natural wonders from lush rainforests to the diversity of the coral reef and sea life, the neighbouring Cocos Keeling Islands offer a different type of paradise to explore.</p>
            <p>Made up of 27 coral islands, of which just two are inhabited, the islands form a horseshoe-shaped atoll enclosing a lagoon that is remarkably shallow at low tide. At the right time, you can walk the entire atoll; the only place in the world where a walk like this is possible.</p>
            <p>The Cocos Keeling Islands can only be described as a deeply tranquil place where a rare level of solitude and simplicity can be found. Here, you can relax on empty beaches, experience the thrill of kite-surfing, visit uninhabited islands by canoe, or snorkel and dive in the pristine waters that surround the islands. Covered in overgrown palm plantations, cabbage bush and other endemic plant varieties, the islands are criss-crossed with tracks and trails waiting to be explored. The shores are either pure white sand, rocky reef or lagoon flats. West Island is the main hub of the Cocos Keeling Islands and is where the airport is located. Ferries depart frequently from West Island bound for the outer islands. </p>

            <p>Direction Island is a picture-perfect tropical island with its white sandy beaches, shady shelters, wood-fired barbeques, eco-toilets and walking trails. Camping is permitted on Direction island, but you’ll need to arrive fully equipped a there is no drinking water or electricity. It’s the perfect place to simply relax in paradise...
