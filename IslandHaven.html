              The Falkland Islands’ remote and rugged terrain offers a unique destination for those who want to experience a true wilderness.

           <p> An archipelago of more than 740 islands, the Falkland Islands are a remote paradise for those in search of rugged wilderness, unique terrain and a jaw-dropping array of wildlife.</p>

             <div class="image pull-right col-lg-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12 col-lg-5">

            </div>

            <p>Lying about 650km off the south-eastern tip of South America and surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, waves sculpt the rugged shores of the islands, which are a mix of mountain ranges and flat plains where scores of species of bird and marine life make their home. Just over 2,000 people reside in the Falkland Islands, which has a land area roughly half the size of Wales.</p>

          

            <p>The two main islands, East Falkland and West Falkland, are linked by air and ferry services and the other islands are accessible by boat and charter services.</p>

            <p>The capital, Stanley, is located on East Falkland, wrapping around the picturesque Stanley Harbour. Perhaps the most remote capital city in the world, it has a distinctly British feel and is an ideal base from which to explore the rest of the islands.</p>

            <p>As a British Overseas Territory, the Falklands are steeped in military history, most notably the conflict in 1982. The secluded outer islands offer a true sense of tranquility; some inhabited by as little as two people.</p>

            <div class="image pull-left col-lg-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12 col-lg-5">
                <img src="Des_/IslandHaven/FalklandsDavidHemmings300dpicopy.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p>Despite the remoteness of the islands and the tiny population, Falkland Islanders are known for their hospitality and there is a vibrant local community in Stanley where more than 75 per cent of the islands’ population live. Eating out in the Falklands is centred around seafood, with mainly local produce used.</p>


            <p>But the islands are renowned mainly for their spectacular wildlife. The best time to go to the Falklands is between November and February for wildlife viewing, while the months between October and April are the prime months if you’re interested in fishing.</p>

            <p>Whales, dolphins, elephant seals, sea lions, and delicate flora and fauna are the highlights in and around the rugged geographical formations of the islands. Nearly 230 species of birds (including several of the world’s largest endangered breeding colonies)also exist on the islands, including large penguin colonies. More than 770,000 penguins reside in the Falklands, which accounts to more than 300 per person, and five of the world’s penguin species can be found in the islands regularly, including gentoo, rockhopper, king, macaroni and Magellanic penguins.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Due to the islands’ sparse population and lack of any heavy industry, human impact on the environment is very limited. As a result, hiking in the countryside offers wide open spaces, pure air and wilderness untouched by man. The miles of white sandy beaches are an experience in themselves, often with only penguins to keep you company.</p>


            <p>From Stanley, it is an easy walk to experience some of the islands’ famed wildlife firsthand. Upland geese are regularly seen strutting along the grassy areas while turkey vultures perch in the trees and southern giant petrels sit along the harbour wall. Along the water’s edge you can see the charismatic Falkland flightless steamer duck, black-crowned night herons, kelp geese and rock cormorants. You might also catch sight of dolphins playing in the harbour.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Accessible by foot from Stanley, you can discover the sand dunes en route to Cape Pembroke Lighthouse, or stroll along the white sand beach of Surf Bay, watching the South Atlantic rollers which often carry seals, dolphins and penguins.</p>

            

            <p> <h2> Getting There </h2>

            LAN flies to the Falkland Islands every Saturday from Santiago via Punta Arenas. Once a month the flight also stops in Rio Gallegos, Argentina.</p>

            <p>Flights are also operated out of the United Kingdom on Sundays and Wednesdays by the Ministry of Defence.</p>
