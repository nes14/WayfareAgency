                 Distinctly different from traditional Mexican fare, Yucatecan cuisine is a mouthwatering melange of European and Caribbean influences and flavours, discovers Faith Coates.

            <p>
            Earthy, hot and smoky, the cuisine of the Yucatán peninsula is as diverse as it is rich in colour. Here, the air is thick with the scent of the strong flavours that make this region’s food a culinary delight.
            </p>

              <div class="image pull-right col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">

                <p class="lead text-center"> Annatto has been called the saffron of the Yucatan and is used to add earthy flavour and colour, and of course the searing heat of the habanero is a staple.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Local produce is everywhere: from the chaya or tree spinach that grows on shrubs to the ground rice and honey that is made into drinks, and the infamous habanero chilli and sour orange that add a zesty spice to many dishes. </p>

           

            <p>Fragrant and spicy, Yucatecan cuisine is influenced by the cooking of various cultures, but the ingredients are distinctly Yucatecan.</p>

            <p>Here, isolated from the rest of Mexico, a unique culinary tradition was born. In days gone by, this area was home port to the Dutch, French, and Spanish and the influx of cultures had a fascinating impact on the local cuisine.</p>

            <p>The region’s contemporary fare is an interesting combination of European and Caribbean flavours as well as Lebanese culinary traditions and regional dishes from other parts of Mexico. </p>

            <p>The trinity of Yucatecan cuisine is naranja agria (sour orange), annatto (a seasoning made from the seeds of the achiote tree which have a distinctive blood red colouring) and habanero chilli pepper. Pipian, a sauce made from ground pumpkin seeds is also popular.</p>

             

            <p>Initially devised as a way to preserve meat in the tropical climate, Pibil has become the region’s most famous dish. A Mayan word that means to bury, or to cook underground, Pibil is pork, or other meat, wrapped in banana leaves and marinated in sour orange and annatto, which is then baked in a cooking pit for several hours.</p>

            <p>Sour orange is indispensable in the Yucatán. Mixed with water and sugar, the juice of sour oranges is made into a beverage called naranjada. More importantly though, unsweetened, it is used like vinegar to pickle vegetables, and is a primary ingredient in the famous Pibil dish when mixed with achiote, or on its own in the wood-grilled pork dish, poc chuc.</p>

            <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">

            </div>


            <p>Annatto has been called the saffron of the Yucatán and is used to add an earthy flavour and colour to various dishes. And, of course, the searing heat of the habanero chilli is a staple.</p>


            <p>Yucatecan cuisine incorporates several ingredients that are not typical of Mexican cuisine but are of Mayan origin. Wild turkey, deer, quail and chaya are all used commonly, and banana leaves are used instead of corn husks to add a distinct flavour. Mixed with traditional Mexican ingredients including avocado, red onion, tomato, corn and, of course, the habanero chilli, the cuisine is abundant in flavour and colour.</p>

            <p>Poc chuc is another favourite dish of the region and is distinctly Yucatecan. Slow-cooked pork is combined with sour orange juice and typically served with a sharp, tangy salad and fried chicharrones.</p>

             <div class="image pull-right col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                <img src="Des_/Mexico/makingtortillasYucatan_.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            
            <p>Other traditional Yucatecan dishes include Sopa de Lima, a chicken and tortilla soup made with the distinctive sour local limes, and papadzules, which are similar to enchiladas. In the simplest form, they consist of a corn tortilla dipped in a sauce of pipian or pumpkin seeds and filled with hard boiled eggs. </p>

            <p>Queso Rellenos is another true Yucatecan dish, which is found nowhere else in Mexico. A rind of Edam cheese is wrapped around a filling of caramelized ground beef, raisins, almonds, spices, and olives, which is then wrapped in banana leaf and steamed.</p>

             

            <p>Pavo en Relleno is another Yucatecan delicacy and is likely incomparable to anything you’ve ever tasted before. The dish is turkey and polenta corn dumplings in a recado negro sauce, which is the key to its flavour and is made from crushed chillies that are then burnt black, and combined with spices.</p>

            <p>Spice mixes are known in the Yucatán as recados. David Sterling, a chef and food historian based in Merida, believes that these seasonings are the original pillars of Yucatecan cuisine. Each recado was created for a specific purpose and is a blend of spices, chillies and other ingredients. </p>

            <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                <img src="Des_/Mexico/deanMilleringredients_.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p>The strong and spicy recado negro blends charred chiles with a range of other spices including achiote seeds, cloves, peppercorns, cumin and oregano. The harsh process of burning chillies produces a fierce, acrid smoke and as a result, the process of making recado negro within the Merida city limits has been banned. The resulting black paste from the chillies is then used as either a rub for meat or as a sauce. Recado roja, a less harsh alternative, uses sour orange and annatto to create a deep red-coloured marinade.</p>

            <p>Tamales are an art in the Yucatan, and have been dated back to the ancient Maya people, who it is believed prepared them as feasts as early as 1200 BC. Made of a starchy, corn-based dough, tamales are steamed or boiled in a banana leaf wrapper, which is discarded before eating. </p>

            <p>Try any of these dishes with a glass of Xtabentún, a liqueur made from anise seed, fermented honey and rum and you’ll never want to leave the Yucatan…</p>


            <p><h2>Getting There</h2>

            The Yucatán Pensinsula is in south-eastern Mexico and separates the Caribbean Sea from the Gulf of Mexico. </p>

            <p>You can fly direct from the USA to the Yucatán Pensinsula and there are infrequent flights operating direct from Europe to Cancún.</p>


            <p>If you’re travelling from elsewhere, most flights are operated into Cancún and arrive via Mexico City.</p>
