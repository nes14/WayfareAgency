                    As temperatures plummet to around 45 degrees below zero and the sea ice begins to form on Hudson Bay, the town of Churchill becomes a hot spot for wildlife enthusiasts.

                                Each year, the shallow waters of Hudson Bay start to freeze around November and from mid-November until June, the bay remains largely frozen. </p>

                                For the western Hudson Bay polar bear population, which is made up of approximately 935 bears, the sea ice pack becomes their hunting ground and is where they spend most of their lives hunting their primary food source, the ringed seal.</p>

                                        Churchill is one of the few human settlements where polar bears can be observed in the wild.

                                In the isolated Arctic town of Churchill, the bears wait around the shore for the sea ice to form every autumn having left their dens on the tundra surrounding the town, where the subsoil remains permanently frozen. </p>
                                
                                <p class="">
                                By autumn, it has been about four months since their last meal. </p>
                                <p class="">
                                The Churchill bears are one of 19 polar bear populations in the world, and by far the most accessible due to their habitual autumnul wait on the edges of the coastal town. Churchill is one of the few human settlements where polar bears can be observed in the wild. According to Manitoba Conservation, polar bears in this area are in decline due to a three per cent loss to the extent of the ice pack every decade, and a spring ice break up occuring approximately three weeks earlier than historical records indicate. When the ice melts, the bears come ashore and fast for about four months, living on stored fat until the following winter. While the majority of bears fast for about four months, pregnant females remain on land to give birth and fast for about eight months. The changing seasonal conditions are also affecting the ringed seal, according to Manitoba Conservation, due to spring rains impacting their maternity dens.</p>

                                In fall, as the ice forms, ringed seals cut breathing holes in the ice using the sharp claws on their foreflippers. These holes are kept open all winter in ice that can get up to two metres thick.
                                The seals surface every few minutes at one of these holes, or use air pockets trapped under ice to breathe. Polar bears stalk their prey by waiting at a breathing hole, sometimes for hours or days. 
                                Weighing in at around 500kg, an adult polar bear can drag a seal from the water with its claws. But ringed seals also bask on the ice and make easy prey for the bears who use the seals’ sleep-wake pattern to slowly creep up on their prey before darting at the seal at explosive speed and killing it before it can retreat to the safety of the ocean.</p>

                                Manitoba lists the polar bear as threatened and there are various regulations in place for tourism operators in the area.</p>

                                The polar bear season, in October and November each year, is the largest contributor to the Churchill’s tourism, and there are a myriad of ways to explore the region at this time of year, including secluded lodges, retreats and from purpose-built viewing vehicles. </p>
