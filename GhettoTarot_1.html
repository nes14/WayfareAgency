	                	Belgian photographer Alice Smeets fell in love with Haiti at the age of 19. Her career has centred on its plight, and potential, ever since.
	                </h3>
               	</div>
               		<p class="">
						Growing up in Eupen, a small town in the German speaking region of Belgium near Cologne, Smeets, 28, had a typically Western upbringing. When she finished high school she left for New Zealand to learn English. 
                    </p>
                           <p class="">
                            It was amidst the evocative landscapes of Aotearoa where Smeets found her passion for photography and first purchased a semi-professional camera. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            After six months though, she returned to Belgium to study photography at a tertiary level, realising that New Zealand was too similar to her homeland to truly enrich her understanding of the world. She craved different, richer cultural experiences.
                            During a university semester break, Smeets set foot on Haitian soil for the first time and ignited her love affair with the country and its people. She spent a number of weeks exploring and photographing children growing up in Haiti’s vast poverty-stricken areas.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Smeets realised she wanted to tell stories with her photographs; to incite change and to open the eyes of the Western world to the circumstances and lives of those in countries such as Haiti.
                            “When I got back to Belgium, I decided the university course wasn’t for me and I was lucky enough to be able to assist famous war photographer Philip Jones Griffiths for three months. They were the last three months of his life. It was a very, very intense time,” she says.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Griffiths not only taught her about lighting, composition and photojournalism, but to ask questions. “I learnt not to just go places and look through the filters of your own upbringing; but to question everything; question the situation, question what you see.”
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Pursuing her dream to incite change, Smeets continued to visit Haiti frequently over the following four years, and finally moved there in 2011.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Her photography continued to develop, alongside her other interests – she set up and ran a workshop to teach Haitians how to become professional photographers.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “But I became disillusioned with the NGO system after my experiences in Haiti over the last few years. I saw how hard it is to really help. There were so many things going wrong with the NGO system but nobody wanted to talk about it because the people involved were all there with the right intentions.”
                            As a consequence, Smeets decided to direct a documentary about the negative effects NGOs were having, using Haiti as an example 
                            of similar countries’ plights. 
                              </p>
                              <div class="image pull-left col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                                <img src="Des_/unnamed-2.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                <p class="lead">
                                    Instead of looking at Haiti as a poor country and showing this to the world with my photographs I wanted to show poverty in a different light – to describe with my images how I see Haiti now.
                                </p>
                              </div>
                           <p class="">
                            “If we help in the wrong way, it can destroy a country,” Smeets says. “One of the many things that are going wrong in Haiti is the victimisation of the people. Many NGO workers don’t even realise they are doing this. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “For the last 50 years, Haitians have witnessed white people come into their country and do everything for them. When an NGO goes to Haiti, it doesn’t let Haitians decide how to lead change so the people are there left to witness, rather than lead, the change. If the change is done for them, they become victims of the situation. 
                            “If there is a problem in Haiti now, people don’t think: ‘What can I do to solve the problem?’ instead, they look to the NGOs to fix it. It’s a very strong mentality in Haiti. They have lost their self confidence about solving problems.”
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Smeet’s disillusion with the NGO system led her to stop taking photographs for a year. She felt helpless about the situation and couldn’t see how to do anything of any worth for Haitians.
                            But then she came up with the idea of creating the Ghetto Tarot, and her inspiration returned.
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “For a long time, I had wanted to interpret the Tarot Deck with my photos, but taking ordinary pictures of the scenes seemed too simple.,” Smeets says. “My aim was to create a very personal deck without loosing the different spirits of the cards. Then the idea
                            entered my mind to combine three of my passions: the spiritual world, the Haitian culture and people, as well as philosophical reflections about the dualities in our world; in this case rich and poor.”
                              </p>

                           <p class="">
                            The resulting Ghetto Tarot is an avant-garde collection of work like no other. A photographic representation of the Rider Waite Tarot deck, originally designed in 1909 by artist Pamela Colman Smith, many of the cards use Haitian art, which includes symbolism from the Voodoo religion to embody the meaning of the cards’ original symbols. “While the original cards were designed many years ago with the situations of a time when the world was very different, they still resonate today with timeless symbols that can be applied to our busy modern world. And not just our modern, Western world, but also to any other continent, country or culture, including the Haitian Ghetto,” Smeets said. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “I realised that instead of looking at Haiti as a poor country and showing this to the world with my photographs, I wanted to show poverty in a different light – to describe with my images how I see Haiti now, as a country rich in creativity and talent and with so much potential.”
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            Created by Smeets in collaboration with Haitian artists’ collective Atis Rezistans (Resistance Artists), each image of the Ghetto Tarot was shot in the slums, and styled only with items that were sourced, or created, in the area. 
                              </p>
                           <p class="">
                            “The artists I collaborated with are so rich in creativity and strength. They don’t see the misery of the area they are living in, but instead see the potential of using the trash that surrounds them and turning it into art. They provide us with a very valuable lesson; we can choose if we see the trash as a problem or as inspiration. Whatever problem we have, whatever negativity we feel, if we choose to look at it from a different perspective we can instantly change the situation. This is the essence of the Ghetto Tarot. It is about how we can all change our reality if we alter our perception.” <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ghetto-tarot-take-two#/" target="_blank">ghettotarot.com</a>
