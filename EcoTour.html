                Jane Jeffries cherishes the laid back lifestyle Rarotonga as she cycles around the island and discovers the lush tropical wilderness of its lesser-known areas
              </h3>
            </div>
            <p class="">
                               As we round the corner on our bikes, we see Natua sitting outside on a stool, sanding the back of a partially completed ukulele. He greets us and as we lay our bikes on the grass, he beckons us inside his work shed.
                                Natua is a young Cook Islander with a very special talent. He makes custom-made ukuleles for discerning musicians.</p>
                                <p class="">
                                We have called in to see him as part of a ‘Storytellers’ eco cycle tour around Rarotonga. Our storyteller, Rebecca, is one of several locals, guiding tourists around the island to learn about the local culture, history and environment.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                It’s not hard to see Natua has a wicked sense of humor. When I ask him how long he has been doing this for, he says, “Since nine o’clock this morning.” Laughing, he corrects himself and says, “I’ve has been making ukuleles for about four years.”
                                </p>
                                <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                                    <img src="Des_/shutterstock_159678242Z.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                  
                                 </div>
                                <p class="">
                                With not a tool out of place or a wood shaving on the floor, he explains how he has had no formal training. “My first ukulele was full of mistakes so I gave it away,” he says. “The second wasn’t much better so I gave it away too,” he says chuckling. He likens his craft to fixing a car, trial and error, but I think there is more to it than that.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                Natua is passionate about his work and is clearly a very talented musician. He believes it is important to put your soul into your ukulele, so encourages his clients to be involved in the crafting process. Some clients like to work with him for a couple of days, while others come just for the finishing touches.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                We say goodbye to Natua and cycle to an agriculture patch owned by one of Rebecca’s relatives. Once an orange orchard, there are a few remaining orange trees and we taste the ripe, sweet fruit, but it is predominantly a pineapple and banana plantation now. The banana trees are lush and very much part of the tropical vegetation but what catches my eye is a beautiful banana flower. The large, purple, bulbous looking flower, hangs from the end of a large bunch of bananas. Peeling back a layer, very small flowers are visible. Each one will soon mature into a banana.
                                </p>
                                <div class="image pull-right col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                                    <img src="Des_/Bananaflower_CookIslandsZ.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
                                   
                                 </div>
                                <p class="">
                                Rebecca explains much of the local vegetation is still used for medicinal purposes including the fragrant frangipani. Demonstrating, she snaps a small branch off the tree, allowing the sap to run freely. This is the remedy for a bee string she says.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                Our next stop is a swamp taro plantation. Having learnt what is involved in the growing and harvesting of this crop, I have a greater appreciation for this local delicacy. The taro seedling is planted in water, under a mat of palm fronds. It is difficult and time consuming to grow but the plant has deep cultural and practical significance. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                One aspect of Rarotonga, that saddens me is the unfinished and now derelict, Sheraton Hotel. 
                                I asked Rebecca if we could visit the site, as it is now a tourist attraction in a weird kind of way. 
                                Thirty years ago, in the mid 1980’s “experts” from the United Nations Development Programme advised the Cook Island government to allow more large hotels. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                With that in mind, the government borrowed $50 million from an Italian Bank and an Italian contracting company started the build. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                However, the construction company went broke and another was bought in from Italy to complete the job, but again the work halted, following mafia allegations.
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                The locals believe the site is cursed but whatever the reason for its checked history, there are no plans to bring it back to life or demolish it.</p>
