             Draped over hills on the bottom of the North Island, Wellington is known for its coffee, cultural nouse and endless outdoor pursuits.

           <p> Between sips of coffee, dawn’s golden and wispy clouds travel across the harbour before us, carried over distant lights in the tight grasp of Wellington’s infamous breath.</p>

            <p>Huddled in hills at the bottom of the North Island, Wellington is an extremely elemental city with wind speeding up as it squeezes through the Cook Strait, between the North and South islands. With views right across to the South Island on a clear day, Wellington is made beautiful by the ever-changing elements. All year around, sun, wind, rain, hail, and a tiny bit of snow paint the city and its surrounding landscape. </p>

            <p>Bound by the sweeping harbour, green undulating hills, forests, and a stretch of rough, typically emerald ocean, Wellington is an unpredictable treasure. Even on the coldest days, the city has much to offer in the form of its dynamic coffee and culinary scene, exhibitions and events. </p>

            


            <p>As the sun peeks over Mt Victoria, the eastern faces of the hills are emblazoned with orange as the morning light streams into the depths of the CBD. Cuba Street, Wellington’s coffee and cultural spine, is the hub of this compact city that packs in more than most cities its size. It’s said to have more bars and restaurants per capita than New York, and the culinary scene is buzzing with ideas and delectable delicacies. Often known as the culinary capital, Wellington is the place to immerse yourself in the food scene. Cocktails, coffee and endless dining options are all within easy walking distance of the main drags, Courtenay Place and Cuba Street, in the central city. </p>

            </div>


            <p>We start our day at Nikau Cafe at the City Gallery; there’s no better place for brunch according to culture guide Concrete Playground, and that’s saying something in this city of coffee and culinary greats. </p>

            <p>With such an abundance of great coffee and eateries, there’s little to stop our optimism as we explore the city and visit the galleries, museums and hidden hotspots locals know and love. </p>

           

            <p>After visiting the latest exhibition at City Gallery, we head to the edge of the city, where a ring of preserved vegetation, forest and wilderness known as the Wellington Town Belt, envelops the central city. This green belt has become a transition point; a route that leads to fresh culinary ideas in the outer city. </p>

            <p>We meet John Paul Henderson and Amy Gillies, owners of Brooklyn’s Salty Pidgin restaurant, who believe they have the best of culture, cuisine and nature on their doorstep. The duo have settled into Brooklyn’s thriving community, which includes the Penthouse Cinema and the famous Brooklyn Deli; on the doorstep, various walks into the pine-forested Brooklyn Central Park begin.</p>

             <div class="image pull-left col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                <img src="Des_/CapitalCool/writers-walk-denis-glover.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>


            <p>There are many walks, biking trails and leafy slices of paradise scattered in and around the city that provide more than just an oasis of calm; these areas are a thriving place of productivity for artists, chefs and writers who utilise the fresh air and open spaces when creating their products and services. </p>

            <p>Mount Victoria is part of the green belt and a climb to the top is well worth it. It provides stunning 360-degree views of the city and is accessible by car or via the walking tracks.</p>

            

            <p>Wellington’s rugged South Coast is perhaps one of the most spectacular places to visit. A 30-minute walking track meanders around the coast from Owhiro Bay to the Red Rocks, an area of national significance. The Red Rocks are ancient pillow lava formed around 200 million years ago by undersea volcanic eruptions. Small amounts of iron oxide give the rocks their distinct reddish colour. The walk continues around to Sinclair Head where a New Zealand fur seal colony resides – an unusual sight so close to a major city.</p>

            <p>A few minutes from central Wellington by taxi or bus, and you’ll find yourself amongst trees of daunting scale. Some of the city’s oldest trees stand within Otari-Wilson’s Bush, including an 800-year-old Rimu. The reserve is the only public botanic garden in New Zealand dedicated solely to native plants. Here, a treetop canopy walkway runs 18 metres above the native forest, which spans 100 hectares. A nature trail leads through the undergrowth below. </p>

            </div>

            <p>The city’s famous restored historic cable car is another way to explore; it climbs the hill from Lambton Quay to the Botanic Gardens where there are yet more sweeping views of the city, harbour and surrounds. </p>

            <p>If you’re venturing to the suburbs, Petone is one of New Zealand’s heritage gems, and is filled with funky eateries, galleries and boutique retailers.</p>
            <p>Or, take a stroll along the waterfront and enjoy the sculptural quotations from some of New Zealand’s best-known writers that form the Wellington Writers Walk. Like a series of intriguing pronouncements, the quotes take the form of contemporary stone sculptures.</p>
            <p>If you want to explore the harbour, hire a sea kayak and paddle around the picturesque bays. Harbour cruises operate between the city and Matiu Island in the middle of the harbour and Days Bay, where cafes and craft shops line the seaside.</p>

                </p>

            <p>There are limitless options for exploring what is arguably one of the world’s coolest capital cities. </p>
            <p>Whether it’s taking in a live show, mountain biking through the re-generating native bush of Makara Peak, exploring a local gallery, or enjoying a cocktail on Cuba, Wellington really does have it all.</p>
