             If you’re stopping over in San Francisco and have limited time, here’s our top picks for places to visit during a quick trip to the city by the bay.
              </h3>
            </div>
         

            
            <h3>The Mission District </h3>

             <div class="image pull-right col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                <img src="Des_/DayBay/DSCN1459.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p> San Francisco’s oldest neighbourhood, the Mission District is now home to some of the city’s hottest new galleries and restaurants, and it’s the place to be for the hipster generation. </p>

           

            <p>It’s a melting pot of cultures and cuisines and it has the largest concentration of murals in the city, which adorn buildings, walls and fences throughout the district, along with delicious cupcakeries, alternative music stores and boutique clothing retailers. </p>

            <h3> The Castro </h3>
             <div class="image pull-left col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                <img src="Des_/DayBay/DSCN1728.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>


            <p>One of the city’s most vibrant communities, The Castro was a quiet suburb until in the 1960s when the area became popular with gay men due to its still low property prices and the charming Victorian housing. When gay rights activist Harvey Milk was assasinated in 1978, The Castro became a close-knit community that celebrated its thriving gay and lesbian population. It retains its vibrant culture and colourful streetscapes; teeming with playful shops, flamboyant bars and the Castro Theater. The Castro is home to rainbow flags and street crossings, glittering wares, and a unique zest for life.</p>

            <br><br>
           
            <h3 class="text-left"> Fisherman’s Wharf</h3>

            <div class="image pull-right col-lg-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 col-lg-4">
                <img src="Des_/DayBay/DSCN1536.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p>San Francisco’s most well known waterfront community has been home to the city’s colourful fishing fleet for more than a century. World famous for its wide variety of seafood, it is a food lover’s haven offering a huge range of dining options from the iconic street stalls that serve steaming hot Dungeness crab to the gourmet restaurants that line the area sidewalks. Chowder served in a bread bowl is a must-try at Fisherman’s Wharf. The wharf is also home to the famous Boudin Bakery, which was first started in 1849 and offers a museum, store, and full-service seafood restaurant.</p>

            

            <h3>111 Mina Gallery</h3>

            <p>This space has a dual identity: art gallery by day and club by night. The gallery showcases a unique blend of local and international artists, world class DJ’s, live performances, and film screenings in an elegantly urban and ever-changing 4,000 square foot space. The gallery is open to the public and nightly on a rotating schedule for special events.</p>

            <p>The sophisticated design of the contemporary space is animated by the bar, a work of art in itself, it is a 25 foot long rolled steel and copper structure created by Bay Area sculptor Jud Bergeron.</p>

            </div>

            <h3> Haight</h3>

            <p>Vintage clothing, books and records are abundant in the Haight, which was made famous by the hippie movement of the 1960s. Fragments of the flower power, incense-burning, tie-dye and peace-and-love of the era are still a central part of the Haight’s retail offerings. But they’re mixed in with exclusive boutiques, high-end second-hand stores and vintage clothing shops, along with hip restaurants and cafes.</p>


            <h3> Alcatraz Island </h3>

            <p>Once home to some of America’s most notorious criminals, the federal prison that operated here between 1934 and 1963 left a mystique to the island that lingers to this day. But it is not just the tours of the former jail that make this island worth a visit. While the crumbling walls of the structure offer a unique insight into its former use, the surrounding gardens are something to behold. Their innate beauty is in direct contrast to the island’s infrastructure that is focused on defense, punishment and confinement. It’s also home to numerous seabirds, which use the island as their nesting ground. </p>

            <p>Ferries leave for the island from Fisherman’s Wharf numerous times a day.</p>
