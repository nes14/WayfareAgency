             Justine Tyerman gets lost in the winding streets of Fes, Morocco, the most well preserved ancient city in the Arab world.
              </h3>
            </div>
            <p>Dodging donkeys is not quite as dangerous as running with the bulls but it’s not entirely without risks. Our guide warned us to take evasive action whenever we heard the call ‘balek, balek’ (Arabic for ‘get out of the way’) as we walked down the labyrinth of alleyways lined with souks in the Medina of Fes el Bali, but we were not quite prepared for the frequency of the donkeys.</p>

            <p>There are about 4,000 donkeys and mules plying the narrow winding paths within the walls of the oldest medina in Morocco, most of which seemed to be out in force the day we were there.
            </p>

                  <p class="lead text-center">Donkeys, mules and hand carts are the life blood of the 9,000 alleyways that crisscross the world’s largest car-free urban space. </p>
            </div>

            <p>We soon became adept at hurling ourselves against a wall of Moroccan babouches (slippers) or carpets as a hand cart or beast of burden clattered by with a load twice its size. It added to the excitement, fun and colour of this quintessentially Fes-esque experience.</p>

            <p>Donkeys, mules and hand carts are the life blood of the 9,000 alleyways that crisscross the world’s largest car-free urban space. With no mechanised transportation to service the souks, man and beast haul all the fresh produce and raw materials demanded daily by the thousands of traders and artisans, as they have done for centuries.
            </p>

            

            <p>The souks sell everything from food to home-wares and many who live and work there never venture beyond their own neighbourhood, our guide Nabil said. There were great bargains to be found in brightly-coloured handbags, shoes, scarves, fabrics, ceramics and carpets once you understood the protocols of the haggling process which ended up with prices about a half to a third of the original figure. The salesmen were invariably good-natured, never aggressive.</p>

            

            <p>My head was on a swivel in Fes with a myriad of sights all clamouring for attention. We spent two days exploring this ancient imperial city. Founded in the 9th century during the Idrisid dynasty, the city is regarded as the spiritual, cultural, intellectual and religious capital of Morocco. The architecture and craftsmanship of the buildings are mind-boggling.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>The royal Palace of Fes is one of the most beautiful in the Arab world with its seven ornate doors of different sizes, richly adorned in bronze and exquisite zellij mosaics flanked with white marble columns. Nearby is the historic Jewish quarter or mellah whose inhabitants have historically lived under the protection of the sultan.</p>

            <p>We entered the medina through the grand central arch of the magnificent Bab Boujloud gates decorated in blue ceramics - the colour associated with Fes - as one enters the medina, and green ceramics - the colour of Islam - as one departs.</p>



            <p>Fes is home to the world’s oldest university, the University of al-Karaouine and associated mosque, founded in 859 by a woman called Fatima al-Fihri. It became a state university in 1963, and remains a bustling institution of learning today.</p>

            <p>The 14th century Madrasa Bou Inania with its characteristic green minaret is one of the few religious places in Morocco open to non-Moslem visitors. Nabil explained the detailed architectural features of the interior – Carrara marble on the floor, zellij mosaics on the walls with cursive script above depicting chapters from the Koran, then carved plasterwork, and cedar from the Atlas Mountains on the ceiling. </p>

            <p>The Nejjarine Museum of wood arts and crafts is a former fondouk, a caravanserai where mules and donkeys were once housed on the ground floor and people on the upper floors. The interior is impressive with white pillars supporting carved dark woodwork balconies. I stopped to smile and nod my admiration to a woman whose life’s work is to lovingly dust all the intricate carvings.</p>

            <p>The museum showcases a vast collection of traditional artefacts, craftsmen’s tools, children’s toys, Berber locks, musical instruments, and massive antique doors. How I wished I could spirit those stunning doors home with me.</p>

            <p>Outside is the beautiful, much photographed 16th century Nejjarine Fountain or Woodworker’s Fountain with its geometric indigo mosaics and carved marble arch.</p> 

            <p>Fes is also famous for its handcrafts. I loved watching the artisans at work especially the young women hand painting huge pots and urns with tiny filaments of colour, and the men with chisels shaping tiny pieces of mosaic for one of the exquisite creations at the Art Naji pottery and mosaics workshop.
            </p>

            </div>


            <p>L’art des Fibule, a multi-level Aladdin’s cave, is full of shiny lanterns and teapots just begging to be rubbed. The array of high-quality jewellery, bronze, brass and silverware was dazzling. A salesman proudly displayed his wares to us while a craftsman expertly tapped out a design on a large brass plate using traditional hand-tools.</p>

            <p>The thousand-year-old Chouara Tannery is an iconic landmark in Fes and although on the day we visited, brown seemed to be the predominant dye, the process was utterly fascinating to observe. The tannery processes cow, sheep, goat and camel hide using methods largely unchanged since medieval times. We watched from a balcony above as men, waist deep in dye, tended to the hides in dozens of stone tubs.</p>
            <p>Be prepared for a powerful stench and accept the sprigs of rosemary handed to visitors. The hides are immersed in a mixture of cow urine, quick-lime, water and salt, then soaked in water and pigeon droppings which contain ammonia that acts as a softening agent, allowing them to become malleable so they can absorb dye. The tanners use bare feet to knead the hides for up to three hours to achieve the desired softness after which they are placed in pits containing natural vegetable dyes - poppy for red, indigo for blue, henna for orange, cedar wood for brown, mint for green, and saffron for yellow. Pomegranate powder is also rubbed on the hides to turn them yellow, and olive oil to make them 
            shiny.</p>


            


            <p>After drying in the sun, the finished product is sold to craftsmen to make the famous Moroccan babouches (slippers), jackets, wallets, handbags and furniture.</p>
            <p>At the end of a day exploring the sights of Fes, I was longing to immerse myself in a cool pool but Nabil seemed to be leading us deeper into the medina. Earlier, he had talked about the blind architecture of the riads, traditional Moroccan houses originally built for extended family groups around a central courtyard which have in modern times been converted into luxury accommodation. Riads have no windows or ‘eyes’ to the outside world – the high walls are blank and therefore ‘blind’ – but once through the doorway into the courtyard, guests are spirited back in time to the grandeur of a past era.</p>

            <div class="image pull-left col-lg-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
                <img src="Des_/LostTime/shutterstock_290143112.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            </div>

            <p>The Riad Res is one such hidden treasure. It was astonishing to one minute be in the crowded, noisy hubbub of the souks and the next in an elegant oasis so tranquil you could hear the fountains tinkling and tea being poured. Deep in the heart of the city’s ancient medina, the riad was once frequented by Fassi nobility. It’s a showpiece of magnificent Andalusian architecture, marvellous mosaics, carved pillars and precious artefacts.</p>
            <p>I forgot all about my swim in the pool as I stood in the central courtyard under an enormous chandelier suspended high in the atrium, mesmerised by prisms of light reflected like fragments of rainbow from the myriad of stained glass windows.</p>
            <p>Comprised of five former grand Fes residences connected by beautiful courtyards with pools, fountains, mosaic and marble staircases and softly-lit passageways, the riad is a clever amalgam of modern facilities and traditional architecture and furnishings. </p>
            <p>Some say Fes is the ‘Mecca of the West’ or the ‘Athens of Africa’ but I say ‘Fes is Fes’. It’s utterly incomparable . . . go there.</p>

          

            <p> <h2>Getting There</h2>

            Flights to Fes are regular and depart frequently from various destinations, including Gatwick and Stanstead in the UK.</p>

            <p>

            Trains operate from daily from Marrakech to Fes and are an inexpensive and reliable way to travel between cities in Morocco.
